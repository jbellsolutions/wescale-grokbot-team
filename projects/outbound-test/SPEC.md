# Outbound test: project spec

**Owner:** Chris · **Builder:** Codex or Claude Code, then a Grok Bot · **Runs on:** Grok Bot, plus a cold email sending tool · **Status:** idea

## 0. Charter

**What:** A capped, measured test of agent-run cold email that books appointments for one offer Chris picks. The agent researches every lead itself, writes a personal first line for each, and books replies onto the calendar.

**Why:**
- On Oct 6 Chris saw Justin's agent running cold email that books appointments.
- Justin offered a slot for an outbound channel Chris wants to test.

**Users:** Chris.

**Done means:** One offer, one list of 500 researched leads and four weeks of sends. The result is booked calls per 1,000 emails and cost per booked call, compared with paid ads, and Chris decides scale or stop.

## 1. How it works

1. **The offer and the ideal customer**, from Chris.
2. **Leads.** The agent finds and researches every lead itself, with the browser and public sources. No rented enrichment databases.
3. **Copy.** Short, specific, one ask, reviewed by the Scale Advisor.
4. **Sending.** Separate sending domains and inboxes, warmed up before any campaign. The Grok Bot never sends from Chris's main domain.
5. **Replies.** Interested replies are drafted into booking replies for Chris or the setter to send. Unsubscribes are honored at once.
6. **Weekly results** to the Dream Map.
