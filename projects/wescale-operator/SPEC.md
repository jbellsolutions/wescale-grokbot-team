# WeScale Operator: project spec

**Owner:** Chris · **Builder:** Chris, with the Dream check-in coaching him · **Runs on:** Grok Bot (business account, or its own account once it has clients' logins) · **Status:** idea

## 0. Charter

**What:** The COG "AI watches everything, Chris manages the exceptions" pattern, applied to WeScale Marketing, Chris's agency.

**Why:** Chris's Oct 15 notes end with the same idea for WeScale later. He listed the areas:
- client reporting;
- campaign monitoring;
- client communication;
- lead QA;
- pipeline;
- billing;
- onboarding;
- team accountability.

**Users:** Chris, and later WeScale's team.

**Done means:** Every morning Chris gets one WeScale brief:
- each client's numbers against target;
- campaigns that need attention;
- clients waiting on a reply;
- invoices due or late;
- onboarding steps overdue.

Every number in it is sourced.

## 1. Why this is Chris's build

Chris asked to be taught to build one agent end to end. The COG team was built for him. This one he builds himself, with the Dream check-in walking him through each step: idea → charter → Profile → skills → connections → routines (paused) → test → live.

## 2. Likely shape (to confirm in the intake)

| Job | Probable skill | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Client reporting | weekly client report draft per client | Ad platforms, CRM |
| Campaign monitoring | daily pulse (reuse `ad-account-pulse`) | Ad platforms |
| Client communication | "who's waiting on us" scan | Slack, email |
| Lead QA | sample new leads for quality | CRM |
| Billing | invoices due or late | Invoicing tool |
| Onboarding | checklist tracker per new client | Drive or project tool |
| Team accountability | EOD and task check (reuse the COG pattern) | Slack, project tool |

## 3. Data

Client data stays in each client's systems and the WeScale vault. Logins for client accounts go on a separate Grok account if the business account shouldn't see them.

## 4. Integrations

To be listed in the intake. Read-only first.

## 5. INPUT NEEDED

- How many clients, what WeScale sells, and the team roster.

## 6. Acceptance

## 7. Build order

1. Client communication scan.
2. Campaign monitoring.
3. Client reports.
