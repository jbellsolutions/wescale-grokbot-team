# Daily sales report (Chris's single source of truth)

## Before anything

Load `/workspace/cog-team/context/cog.json` and `/workspace/cog-team/repo/docs/KPI-DEFINITIONS.md`. If the EOD source or GHL is not configured, reply `NO_CLIENT_SOURCE: <missing>` and stop.

GoHighLevel is read through the `ghl` command (`/workspace/cog-team/ghl-super-hub/ghl`, read-only token; its private skills give the exact calls). The EOD sheet and calendars come through Connect apps.

## Steps

1. **Report date:** the previous selling day (ET). If it isn't in `business.selling_days`, write "No selling day" and stop.
2. **Reported numbers:**
   - Sum each mapped field (`eod.field_map`) per rep and for the team.
   - Missing reps contribute nothing. List them separately and never estimate their numbers.
3. **Verified numbers (GHL + calendar)** for the calendars in `ghl.calendars` on the report date:
   - appointments scheduled, cancelled, rescheduled, showed, no-show and still-open, per closer
   - setter attribution, by who booked
   - closes and deposits from opportunities/stages, if configured
4. **Reconcile** every overlapping count:
   - Use the "Two numbers, never one" rule from `KPI-DEFINITIONS.md`.
   - Flag per rep where the reported and verified numbers differ by the threshold or more.
5. **Pull in the other audits** for the report date:
   - `cog-disposition-audit`
   - `cog-calendar-reconciliation`
   - `cog-no-show-audit` (the sweeps already logged these in `/workspace/cog-team/data/audits/`; re-run only for gaps)
6. **Compute the derived metrics** and the vs-target figures. With no targets set, compare to the same weekday last week and to the 4-week average.
7. **Build the attention list:**
   - only exceptions
   - one line each
   - rep, problem, evidence link
   - sorted by money at risk, then by repeat offenders
8. **Save** the full report to `/workspace/cog-team/vault/Daily/<report date>.md` under `## Sales report` and the short version to `/workspace/cog-team/daily/<today>/sales.md`. Chief puts the headline in the 8:30 AM brief. Message nobody. Any source you couldn't read goes on the run-log line as `UNKNOWN: <source>`.

## Output (short version, under 180 words)

## Rules

- Every flag links to its evidence.
- Any source that failed shows as `⚠ unknown`, and the metrics that depend on it are marked "partial".
- Never state a total built from a partial source as if it were complete.
