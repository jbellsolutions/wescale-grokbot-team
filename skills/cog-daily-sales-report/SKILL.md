# Daily sales report (Chris's single source of truth)

## Before anything

Load `config/cog.json` and `docs/KPI-DEFINITIONS.md`. If the EOD source or GHL is not configured, reply `NO_CLIENT_SOURCE: <missing>` and stop.

## Steps

1. **Report date:** the previous selling day (ET).
2. **Reported numbers:**
   - Sum each mapped field (`eod.field_map`) per rep and for the team.
   - Missing reps contribute nothing. List them separately and never estimate their numbers.
3. **Verified numbers (GHL + calendar)** for the configured sales calendars on the report date:
   - appointments scheduled, cancelled, rescheduled, showed, no-show and still-open, per closer
   - setter attribution, by who booked
   - closes and deposits from opportunities/stages, if configured
4. **Reconcile** every overlapping count:
   - Use the "Two numbers, never one" rule from `docs/KPI-DEFINITIONS.md`.
   - Flag per rep where the reported and verified numbers differ by the threshold or more.
5. **Pull in the other audits** for the report date:
   - `cog-disposition-audit`
   - `cog-calendar-reconciliation`
   - `cog-no-show-audit` (the sweeps already logged these; re-run only for gaps)
6. **Compute the derived metrics** and the vs-target figures. With no targets set, compare to the same weekday last week and to the 4-week average.
7. **Build the attention list:**
   - only exceptions
   - one line each
   - rep, problem, evidence link
   - sorted by money at risk, then by repeat offenders
8. **Save** the full report to `vault/Daily/<report date>.md` under `## Sales report`. Send the short version to Chief (and to Chris directly if he set `owner.report_channel`).

## Output (short version, under 180 words)

## Rules

- Every flag links to its evidence.
- Any source that failed shows as `⚠ unknown`, and the metrics that depend on it are marked "partial".
- Never state a total built from a partial source as if it were complete.
